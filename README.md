# todo list kata 

We will practice this kata: the [ToDo list](https://github.com/liip/coding-dojo-katas/tree/master/02_todo_list).

In our version, we will create a ToDo list manager.

It will be created in an incremental fashion:

- First deliverable: CLI version, in-memory storage
- Second: add tags, categories, projects. add file persistence
- Third: add multiple system users, add persistence to the cloud
- Fourth: add multi-device sync (including conflict resolution)
